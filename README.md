# Code Overview

This code is a Python script that performs various text analysis tasks on a list of URLs and saves the results in an Excel file. The code uses the Playwright library to scrape text from web pages, performs text analysis on the scraped data, and then saves the results in an Excel file.

## Dependencies

Before running this code, you need to ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install these libraries using pip:

- Playwright: Used for web scraping.
- Pandas: Used for working with data.
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Used for text analysis.

## Code Explanation

Here is an overview of the code:

1. Import necessary libraries, including Playwright, Pandas, and NLTK.
2. Load a list of stopwords from text files.
3. Define functions for cleaning text by removing stopwords, counting positive and negative words, and calculating various text analysis metrics.
4. Create a dictionary to store the results of text analysis.
5. Read a list of URLs from an Excel file.
6. For each URL in the list:
   - Scrape the text from the web page using Playwright.
   - Clean and preprocess the text.
   - Calculate various text analysis metrics.
   - Store the results in the dictionary.
7. Convert the dictionary into a Pandas DataFrame.
8. Save the DataFrame to an Excel file.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have installed the required libraries (Playwright, Pandas, NLTK).

2. Create an input Excel file containing a list of URLs. Ensure that the Excel file has the following columns: 'URL_ID' and 'URL'.

3. Modify the paths and file names used in the code to match your local file system.

4. Run the script.

5. The results of the text analysis will be saved in an Excel file named "Output Data Structure.xlsx" in the specified output directory.

Please note that you should customize the code to suit your specific use case and file paths.

Enjoy analyzing text data!
